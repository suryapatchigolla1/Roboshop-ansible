Executive Summary — roboshop-ansible
The roboshop-ansible repository is intended to serve as a centralized platform for learning Ansible basics and implementing Configuration Management for all Roboshop components within the roboshop/ directory.

Modern Configuration Management with Ansible Ansible enables infrastructure and application automation in a scalable, declarative, and platform-independent manner, reducing the operational complexity associated with traditional Bash scripting.

Supports Both Push and Pull Automation Models Ansible is one of the few Configuration Management tools that supports both:

Push Mechanism — where a centralized Ansible control node connects to target servers over SSH (port 22) and pushes configurations remotely.
Pull Mechanism — where managed nodes independently pull configurations from a Git repository and apply them locally.
Push Mechanism Characteristics Push-based automation requires:

Ansible installed on the central control node.
Network connectivity between the control node and managed servers.
Proper SSH authentication and credentials management, commonly through a dedicated ansible-user.
Stable or known server IPs and network accessibility.
Pull Mechanism Characteristics Pull-based automation requires:

Ansible installed directly on the managed node.
Connectivity from the node to the Git repository containing automation code.
Distributed execution capability without depending on centralized inbound connectivity.
Declarative Automation Using YAML Playbooks Unlike Bash, where automation logic is written as imperative scripts, Ansible uses Playbooks written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). YAML-based automation is declarative, human-readable, easier to maintain, and better suited for large-scale infrastructure management.

Executive Summary — Introduction to Ansible
What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source automation and configuration management tool used for:

Server provisioning
Application deployment
Configuration management
Infrastructure automation
It is agentless, meaning no software needs to be installed on target servers. It primarily uses SSH for communication.

Installing Ansible
Core Concept
Ansible is a Python-based application and is commonly installed using Python package managers like pip.

Default Installation via DNF
dnf install ansible -y
This usually installs ansible-core from the OS repository.

On RHEL/Rocky/AlmaLinux 9, this often provides:

ansible-core 2.14
Equivalent to Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform version 7-era tooling.
Installing Latest Ansible via PyPI
PyPI Ansible Package

Why PyPI?
PyPI provides the latest upstream Ansible versions faster than OS repositories.

Python Requirement
Latest Ansible releases require newer Python versions (Python 3.12+ recommended).

Suggested Installation Steps
dnf install python3.12 -y

pip3.12 install ansible
Important Correction
The original note mentions:

dnf remove python -y
This is risky and not recommended because:

System Python is required by the operating system.
Removing it can break package management and core OS tools.
Instead:

Install Python 3.12 alongside the existing version.
Use pip3.12.
Inventory in Ansible
Ansible manages servers using an Inventory file.

The inventory contains:

IP addresses
Hostnames
Groups of servers
Example:

[dev]
172.31.22.44

[prod]
172.31.22.26
How Ansible Works
Ansible operates mainly using:

Ad-hoc Commands
Playbooks
1) Ad-hoc Commands
Ad-hoc commands are:

One-line commands
Used for quick operations
Best for testing or small tasks
Example: Ping Servers
ansible -i inventory all \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
-m ansible.builtin.ping
Key Components
Component	Meaning
-i inventory	Inventory file
all	All hosts in inventory
-e	Extra variables
-m	Module name
Using Groups
ansible -i inventory prod \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
-m ansible.builtin.ping
Here:

prod refers to a server group in inventory.
Installing Packages via Ad-hoc Command
ansible -i inventory dev \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
-m ansible.builtin.package \
-a "name=nginx state=present" \
--become
What this does
Targets all servers in the dev group
Installs nginx
--become executes commands with elevated privileges (sudo/root)
2) Playbooks
Playbooks are YAML-based automation files that allow:

Multiple tasks
Sequential execution
Reusability
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Example capabilities:

Install packages
Configure services
Deploy applications
Restart services
Key Takeaways
Ansible is an agentless automation tool built on Python.
Latest versions are best installed via PyPI using modern Python versions.
Inventory files define managed servers and groups.
Ad-hoc commands are suitable for quick operations.
Playbooks provide scalable and reusable automation workflows.
Modules are the building blocks of Ansible automation.
Executive Summary — YAML & Ansible Playbooks
Introduction to YAML
YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language widely used in Ansible playbooks and configuration management.

YAML files typically use:

.yml
.yaml
extensions.

Unlike Bash scripting, YAML is indentation-sensitive, meaning spacing must remain consistent throughout the file.

Core YAML Concepts
1) Dictionary
A single key associated with a single value.

name: Martin D'vloper
job: Developer
2) List
A key associated with multiple values.

skills:
  - lisp
  - fortran
  - erlang
3) Map
A structure containing multiple key-value pairs grouped together.

Understanding Ansible Playbooks
What is a Playbook?
A playbook is a YAML file containing a list of plays.

What is a Play?
A play is a collection of tasks executed against a set of servers.

What is a Task?
A task represents a single operation that Ansible executes, such as:

Installing packages
Starting services
Creating files
Deploying applications
Running an Ansible Playbook
Example command:

ansible-playbook -i inventory \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
01-playbook.yaml
Key Parameters
Parameter	Purpose
-i inventory	Specifies inventory file
-e	Passes extra variables
ansible-playbook	Executes playbook files
Variable Types in Ansible
Ansible supports multiple variable scopes.

1) Play-Level Variables
Variables defined at the play scope.

2) Task-Level Variables
Variables defined specifically for a task.

3) Command-Line Variables (CLI Variables)
Variables passed during runtime using -e.

Example:

ansible-playbook -i inventory \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
03-cliVar.yml \
-e URL=url.google.com
Variable Precedence
Ansible resolves variables using the following priority order:

CLI Variables > Task Variables > Play Variables
Command-line variables override all lower-level variables.

Understanding Ansible Facts
What are Facts?
Facts are system properties automatically gathered by Ansible before playbook execution.

Examples include:

IP address
Hostname
OS version
CPU details
Memory information
When a playbook targets multiple servers, Ansible gathers facts from each server individually.

Gathering Facts
Viewing Gathered Facts
ansible -i inventory prod \
-e ansible_user=ec2-user \
-e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
-m ansible.builtin.gather_facts
Controlling Fact Gathering
By default:

Ansible gathers facts automatically.
This behavior can be disabled:

gather_facts: no
Why Disable Fact Gathering?
Faster playbook execution
Reduced overhead
Useful when system information is unnecessary
Important Note
If fact gathering is disabled:

Accessing facts inside the playbook will result in failures because the facts were never collected.
Key Takeaways
YAML is the foundational language for Ansible playbooks.

Proper indentation is critical in YAML.

Ansible playbooks are structured as:

Playbook → Plays → Tasks
Variables can be defined at multiple levels with defined precedence.

Facts provide detailed server metadata automatically.

Fact gathering can be enabled or disabled depending on automation requirements.

# Ignoring Task Failures in Ansible

In `ansible-playbook`, if a particular task fails, the subsequent tasks will **not** be executed by default.

If you want to ignore the failure of a specific task, or if you do not care whether the task succeeds or fails, you can use the `ignore_errors` option for that task.

Example:

```yaml
- name: Remove a file if it exists
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /tmp/sample.txt
    state: absent
  ignore_errors: yes
What is Ansible Vault?
ansible-vault helps encrypt sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and secrets.

It converts plain-text secrets into an encrypted format, which can only be decrypted using a vault password.

Example use cases:

Database passwords
SSH credentials
API tokens
Cloud secrets
One important limitation of ansible-vault is that the encrypted data is primarily understandable only by Ansible itself. If multiple tools or platforms need access to the same secrets, this approach becomes less flexible.

Because of this, most organizations prefer a centralized secret management solution instead of a decentralized approach.

Popular centralized secret management tools include:

AWS Secrets Manager
HashiCorp Vault
Azure Key Vault
Google Secret Manager
These tools allow multiple applications, platforms, and automation tools to securely access secrets from a common location.

Encrypting Secrets Using Ansible Vault
Encrypt a Specific String
ansible-vault encrypt_string 'robo@1'
You will be prompted to enter a vault password.

Example output:

!vault |
          $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
          6438616537396239343964366637313962...
You can directly place this encrypted value inside your playbooks or variable files.

Running a Playbook with Vault Password
ansible-playbook -i inventory \
  -e ansible_user=ec2-user \
  -e ansible_password=DevOps321 \
  10-secrets.yaml \
  --ask-vault-pass
While executing the playbook, Ansible will prompt for the vault password in order to decrypt the encrypted secrets.

Important Note About Ansible Vault
With ansible-vault, tracking and auditing secret access becomes difficult compared to enterprise-grade centralized secret management systems.

Modern secret management solutions provide:

Access control
Audit logging (AAA: Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
Secret rotation
Fine-grained permissions
Centralized governance
This is one of the reasons why teams often prefer tools like:

HashiCorp Vault
AWS Secrets Manager
Azure Key Vault
Google Secret Manager
Ansible Roles
Writing playbooks on their own can be difficult to manage, and it is often unclear which files are used by which playbook. You may not know which variable file is used by a given playbook.

The best hardened approach to handle playbooks is using Ansible Roles.

Ansible roles provide a standard way of organizing playbooks, associated variable files, templates, and other files. With roles, you can write once and reuse multiple times, which helps keep the code DRY.

Here is the documented way of using Ansible Roles. Names are strictly enforced, and tasks/ should contain main.yml to execute by default.

How to run a specific role?

ansible-playbook -i inv-dev -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 roboshop.yml
The roles to run are described in the playbook under the roles: section.

Example role structure:

roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
            main.yml      #  <-- tasks file can include smaller files if warranted
        handlers/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- handlers file
        templates/        #  <-- files for use with the template resource
            ntp.conf.j2   #  <------- templates end in .j2
        files/            #
            bar.txt       #  <-- files for use with the copy resource
            foo.sh        #  <-- script files for use with the script resource
        vars/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- variables associated with this role
        defaults/         #
            main.yml      #  <-- default lower-priority variables for this role
        meta/             #
            main.yml      #  <-- role dependencies
        library/          # roles can also include custom modules
        module_utils/     # roles can also include custom module_utils
        lookup_plugins/   # or other types of plugins, like lookup in this case
We completed the project in a hardwired way and it did not meet the NFRs:

Code was repeated, so the code was WET. I want to identify common patterns and make the code DRY by writing a role with shared patterns and calling it.
Re-run should work, and it does.
Infrastructure was created manually and I want that automated (we do that with Terraform).
We are running the Ansible playbook from the workstation; we want it to run from a UI (CI framework).
When calling a role, only the tasks in main.yml are executed. Can we execute the tasks in tasks/nodejs.yml from a role common? Yes. That is called including the role, which can be done as follows:

- name: Run tasks/other.yml instead of main
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: myrole
    tasks_from: other
Dry status:

NodeJS components are 100% dry.
Java components are 100% dry.
Python components are 100% dry.
Next concepts are :

ansible-pull: We can login to the server that needs ansible configuriaton management, we can direccly point the command to the playbook on git and run the playbook directly.

ansible-pull expects ansible to be installed on the servers you're running the command.

you don't need to maintain separate server to act as a ansible-node.

Role Dependency: This ensures whenever we run a role-x and if it needs role-y to be executed first then it ensure that role-y to be run first.

Let's say for shipping component, mysql is dependent and if you run shipping without mysql , shipping wll fail.

We can create dependency in the shipping statng mySql as dependeent role, whenever you run shipping mysql wll be executed first and that dependency s configured in the meta/main.yml

How to run ansible-pull ? To run ansible-pull., here are the instructions: 1) Log in to the server that needs Ansible Configuration Management 2) Ensure ansible is installed on the servre ( If not install it ) 3) Then run the ansible-pull using the below command, no need of auth or anything ( At this point of time, the only endPoint supported by ansible pull is from GIT )..

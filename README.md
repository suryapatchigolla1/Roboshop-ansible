# Roboshop-ansible
Executive Summary — roboshop-ansible
The roboshop-ansible repository is intended to serve as a centralized platform for learning Ansible basics and implementing Configuration Management for all Roboshop components within the roboshop/ directory.

Modern Configuration Management with Ansible Ansible enables infrastructure and application automation in a scalable, declarative, and platform-independent manner, reducing the operational complexity associated with traditional Bash scripting.

Supports Both Push and Pull Automation Models Ansible is one of the few Configuration Management tools that supports both:

Push Mechanism — where a centralized Ansible control node connects to target servers over SSH (port 22) and pushes configurations remotely.
Pull Mechanism — where managed nodes independently pull configurations from a Git repository and apply them locally.
Push Mechanism Characteristics Push-based automation requires:

Ansible installed on the central control node.
Network connectivity between the control node and managed servers.
Proper SSH authentication and credentials management, commonly through a dedicated ansible-user.
Stable or known server IPs and network accessibility.
Pull Mechanism Characteristics Pull-based automation requires:

Ansible installed directly on the managed node.
Connectivity from the node to the Git repository containing automation code.
Distributed execution capability without depending on centralized inbound connectivity.
Declarative Automation Using YAML Playbooks Unlike Bash, where automation logic is written as imperative scripts, Ansible uses Playbooks written in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language). YAML-based automation is declarative, human-readable, easier to maintain, and better suited for large-scale infrastructure management.
